## Overview of the project

### Project: PYTHON PROGRAMMING INTERNSHIP TASKS 

### Objective

The objective of creating a simple calculator program in Python is to build a tool that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### Key Activities

- **User Choice Handling** : Based on the user’s choice (e.g., 1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.), the program should call the corresponding function.

- **User Interaction and Input** : The program should interact with the user, allowing them to choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).It should prompt the user to input two numbers.


### Technologies Used

- **Python Programming Language** : Python is the primary technology here. It’s a versatile, high-level language known for its readability and ease of use. Python allows you to express complex logic in a concise manner.
- **Functions** : Functions are essential for organizing your code. You’ll define functions for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Example: add(x, y), subtract(x, y), multiply(x, y), and divide(x, y).
- **Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)** : You’ll use conditional statements to determine which operation the user wants to perform (based on their input).
For instance, if the user selects “1,” you’ll call the addition function; if they select “2,” you’ll call the subtraction function, and so on.
